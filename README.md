# Hello friend 🤝  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about public digitalization, open source, and making complex topics accessible to everyone.  

## 🦦 About me  
- I work with **public digitalization** and open source collaboration.  
- I have a background in **communication and branding**, helping organizations tell their stories in meaningful ways.  
- I love **knowledge sharing**—whether through workshops, writing, or online courses.  
- I believe in **open source as a community-driven force** that benefits us all.  

## 🚴 When I'm not working...  
In my free time, I'm writing an **autofiction novel about how the Tour de France can save lives (and a woman in crisis)**—told in a humorous and heartfelt way. Cycling might just be the ultimate metaphor for endurance, suffering, and unexpected joy.

- Ideas and experiments related to **open source collaboration**  
- Insights on **digital communication** and **facilitation**  
- Projects exploring **how we can make digital solutions more accessible and engaging**  

## 🕊 What I care about  
- **Building strong communities** through open collaboration  
- **Creating clear and compelling communication**—tech is only as good as our ability to share it  
- **Keeping it fun**—a bit of humor never hurts when working with digital challenges  

Feel free to connect with me here or on Substack! Let's build something meaningful together 👯
